                    I wanted to destroy Twitter like any other young men. But I didn't have enough clarity. There was a lot of information, so it overwhelmed to the point where I didn't know what to do. That's where Yashveer comes in. He inspired me to DESTROY twitter and gave me all the tactics he knew. If you are a masculine man who wants to understand the twitter game, then he's the right coach for you!
